## ✨ Features

### 🔐 Authentication
- Signup and Login with Appwrite Account sessions
- Session detection on app load and persistent auth state via Redux
- Auth-aware routing using a lightweight `AuthLayout` guard

### 📝 Posts (CRUD)
- Create and edit posts with a Rich Text Editor (TinyMCE)
- Auto-generated slugs from titles with live updates and validation
- List all active posts and view single post pages
- Update or delete posts (server-side via Appwrite Databases)

### ✍️ Rich Text Editing
- TinyMCE editor integrated via React Hook Form `Controller`
- Content saved as HTML and rendered safely with `html-react-parser`

### 📷 File Uploads & Media
- Upload featured images to Appwrite Storage
- Display images using `getFileView` URLs (no paid transformations required)

### 🎨 UI/UX
- Tailwind CSS styling
- Reusable form components (Input, Select, RTE, Button)
- Header/Footer layout and Post cards

### 🛣️ Routing
- React Router v6+ with nested routes and `<Outlet />`
- Guarded routes to restrict access based on auth state

### 💻 Dev Experience
- Vite for fast HMR
- ESLint with React Hooks rules

## 📝 Notes

- **TinyMCE**: For cloud usage, obtain a free API key from Tiny Cloud and add it to the editor init. Self-hosting is also possible.
- **Appwrite Image Previews**: Free plans block image transformations. This project uses `getFileView` to serve original images without transformations.
- **Slug Handling**: Slug auto-updates from the title via `watch` + `setValue`. You can keep the slug editable by attaching `onInput` on the slug field.
